Game em Java (IDE: Eclipse)

Goals to achieve:

#1 - Start game with option "START GAME" then our goal is to display a counter in JFrame called "janela" but inside frame and not new one created.

#2 - Random a 22 image players in janela borderlayout.south and users can drag and drop them in the field.

#3 - When click in start in timer game run for 45 minutes and run a mp3 sound like a whistle to stop game, then after 10 sec game return for another 45 minutes, in any time users can drag and drop for at least maximum 3 players to substitute.

Every person who help me i'll be grateful and in credits for the game that name will be included.
